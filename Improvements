The way we name: A-B or A-B-C, A is the country, B is character name, C is the different looks of that character. Not all character have different looks.
One character may have two country version, for example A1-B and A2-B. One character may have multiple looks, for example B-C1, B-C2.

Improvements to be made:
1. Add options to get different number of images: 1, 2, 4 (random), 4 (1 from each country), 6, 8 (random), and 8(2 from each country)
2. Except for 1 image, make sure the character (B) is not repeated within one shuffle.
3. Maybe challenging. Given multiple players are doing the shuffle togther, don't want different players get the same character.
